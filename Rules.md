# DiamondHacks Hackathon Rules

_Originally forked from the official [MLH Hackathon Rules](https://github.com/MLH/mlh-hackathon-rules)._

## The spirit of the competition

Remember that hackathons are like marathons. Some people go to compete but most people take part to better themselves and have fun. Whatever the reason is you're at a hackathon, make sure you're upholding the [hacker spirit](https://medium.com/@tfogo/the-spirit-of-hackathons-a0d81a65060a#.6cx5ac9t8) by collaborating with other teams, helping beginners, and having fun.


## The rules of the competition

1. There is no maximum or minimum team size. However, we have a maximum of 4 prizes to award to each winning team. If your team is fewer than 4 people, you will only receive the number of prizes equal to the people on your team. If your team is greater than 4 people, you will receive only 4 prizes to share amongst your team. For example, a team of 3 people will receive 3 prizes and a team of 5 people will receive 4 prizes.
2. Teams should be made up exclusively of students who are not organizers, volunteers, judges, sponsors, or in any other privileged position at the event. 
3. You may not do any work prior to the beginning of the hackathon other than ideation and team formation.
4. You may work on your hack anytime between 9:30am on Saturday, March 4th - 3:00pm on Sunday, March 5th, 2023, including overnight.
5. Teams must stop hacking once the time is up. However, teams are allowed to debug and make small fixes to their programs after time is up. e.g. If during demoing your hack you find a bug that breaks your application and the fix is only a few lines of code, it's okay to fix that. Making large changes or adding new features is not allowed.
6. Teams can of course gain advice and support from organizers, volunteers, sponsors, and others.
7. Teams can use an idea they had before the event.
8. Teams can work on ideas that have already been done. Hacks do not have to be “innovative”. If somebody wants to work on a common idea they should be allowed to do so and should be judged on the quality of their hack. These days it’s hard to find something that’s fully original and teams might not know an idea has been done before anyway.
9. Teams can work on an idea that they have worked on before (as long as they do not re-use code).
10. Teams can use libraries, frameworks, or open-source code in their projects. Working on a project before the event and open-sourcing it for the sole purpose of using the code during the event is against the spirit of the rules and is not allowed.  
11. Adding new features to existing projects is allowed. Judges will only consider new functionality introduced or new features added during the hackathon in determining the winners.
12. Projects that violate the [Code of Conduct](http://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf) are not allowed. 
13. Teams can be disqualified from the competition at the organizers' discretion. Reasons might include but are not limited to breaking the Competition Rules, breaking the [Code of Conduct](http://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf), or other unsporting behaviour.
14. You may not cross-post your hack to other hackathons. All code submitted for DiamondHacks must be new, however you may add to existing code as mentioned in Rule #9. You are also welcome to attend DiamondHacks workshops while attending workshops at other hackathons at the same time! [Added on 3/24/21]


## Remember!

The competition is just a part of the hackathon. To make the most out of the event, try something new, teach other people, and make new friends!

Happy Hacking!
